      <p>
        The imperative to safeguard Craven Road from extensive infill and
        secondary builds along the Ashdale Avenue and Parkmount Road
        through-lots stems from the stark contrast in spatial dynamics and
        breathing room compared to neighboring streets. Craven Road, though
        often humorously referred to as the "ass end" of another area, holds
        significant importance to its residents, as it constitutes their
        immediate visual environment upon stepping out of their homes.
        Characterized by narrowness and predominantly single-sided housing,
        Craven Road already grapples with high population density. Further
        development along adjacent through-lots would exacerbate these
        challenges, diminishing the quality of life for current residents and
        compromising the unique character of the neighborhood. Hence, preserving
        Craven Road's integrity becomes paramount, ensuring residents continue
        to enjoy a sense of space and community in their immediate surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is evident from these photos, that Craven Road is not only narrower,
        but it is unique in that it has houses only on one side of it. Craven
        only has a sidewalk on the east side of the road and the setbacks to the
        homes are, in most cases, smaller than average. It is interesting to
        study the difference in streetscapes between Craven Road and it’s
        neighbors to the east (Rhodes Avenue) and west (Parkmount Road and
        Ashdale Avenue). Although Craven Road, with it’s quaint, tiny,
        cottage-like houses already has a very high density, it is obvious that
        the roads around us enjoy a much broader home to home space.
      </p>

      <h2>Craven North</h2>
      <p>
        Craven Road north of Hanson Street was never widened 100 years ago. That
        is why it does not have a fence and is only approximately 4.5 meters (15
        feet) road width. There is no parking on the street. The homes on the
        east side of Craven are densely packed with tiny houses around 500 sq.
        ft. jammed in cheek by jowl, with shallow frontages, and tiny backyards,
        some less than 13 ft x 20 ft (3.96 x 6.01 meters).

      <h2>Is Craven narrow?</h2>
      <p>
        Historically, Craven Road provided housing for workers which explains
        the many small cottage like homes that still line the street. Although
        the south of Craven Road was widened and is now up to 7.5 meters wide,
        the north end remains exceptionally narrow - 4.5 meters wide. Protecting
        access to our street is important not only for emergency and fire
        vehicles, but in order for residents to access their homes. The traffic
        on the street is fairly quiet and it is the reason many of us moved to
        Craven Road.

      <h2>Craven Road Walls at Intersections</h2>
      <p>
        Craven Road intersects with the following East-West streets: Queen
        Street East, Dundas Street East, Gerrard Street East, Fairford Avenue,
        Hanson Street, Mountjoy Avenue and Danforth Avenue. At many of these
        intersections the buildings are very close to the sidewalk/road
        allowance and rise up as sheer walls. Since nobody “lives” across from
        each other at these intersections there are no immediate privacy issues.
        The images presented here show the effect of sheer walls on the very
        narrow Craven Road. Preserving the skyviews, tree canopies, sunlight on
        the rest of the street becomes all the more important if we don’t want
        to replicate the appearance of the intersections at the Craven Road
        intersections.

      <h2>Laneways Around the Neighbourhood</h2>
      <p>
        Craven Road is obviously not a laneway, despite it’s narrow width. It
        has homes on only the east side and is probably the most unique and
        narrowest street in Toronto. There ARE laneways in and around the Craven
        Road neighborhood. A depiction of these clearly demonstrates where
        laneway housing might be more appropriate, without detracting from the
        quality of life afforded to the already densely packed homes on Craven
        Road.

      <h2>Parkmount Road</h2>
      <p>
        Parkmount Road is located one street west of Craven Road and has two way
        traffic between Danforth Avenue on the north and joins the junction of
        Hanson Street which becomes Felstead Avenue (east west streets south of
        Parkmount). Parkmount Road is 30 feet wide, (9.1 meters) with ample
        sidewalks, a grass boulevard between the sidewalk and the road and large
        setbacks to the homes on either side of the road. Since the homes on the
        east side of Parkmount Road are located on through lots, their parking
        spaces are accessed from Craven Road.

      <h2>Rhodes North</h2>
      <p>
        Rhodes Avenue is located one street east of Craven Road. The road north
        of the railway line is 28.4 feet wide which is 8.65 meters and is a two
        way street. It has large sidewalks on both sides of the street, large
        setbacks and homes on both sides of the road. The gardens of the homes
        on the west side of Rhodes Street are adjacent to the tiny gardens of
        the Craven Road homes. When homes on the west side of Rhodes are
        enlarged, they are extended into their gardens, bringing them closer to
        the tiny homes on the east side of Craven Road.

      <h2>Craven South</h2>
      <p>
        From these images, it's evident that Craven Road is narrower and has
        houses only on one side, with smaller setbacks and a sidewalk on the
        east side. This contrast is striking when compared to its neighbors,
        Rhodes Avenue and Ashdale Avenue. On the south side, Craven Road boasts
        the longest municipal fence in Toronto (approximately 1.2 km long) .
        Because this one way street is somewhat wider than the north end of
        Craven Road, it provides parking to the densely packed Craven Road
        residents. The urban tree canopy lining the municipal fence on the
        Ashdale side, is an integral part of the streetscape on Craven Road
        south.
