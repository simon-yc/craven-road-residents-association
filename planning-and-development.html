      <h2>How Other Neighbourhoods Preserve Their Unique Character</h2>
      <p>
        Craven Road character guidelines will hopefully be developed soon! The
        following documents are good examples of how we might think about our
        neighborhood:

            <a
              href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/leaside-residential-character-preservation-guidelines/"
              >Leaside Residential Character Preservation Guidelines</a
            >: these guidelines are unique given their recommendation that
            residents “preserve any trees on private property that are greater
            than 15 cm. in diameter". The
            <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/municode/1184_813.pdf"
              >City of Toronto Trees By-law</a
            >
            prohibits the injury, destruction, or removal of any tree on private
            property that is greater than 30 cm in diameter. Considering how
            long it takes trees to grow 15 cm in diameter, this might well be a
            consideration that Craven Road could adopt.
