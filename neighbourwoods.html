        Nemo, a student from the University of Toronto, who is in the Masters of
        Forestry Program, will be starting an inventory of the trees in our
        neighborhood. The area they are covering includes Craven Road stretching
        from Queen Street to Danforth Avenue, the backyards of the houses on the
        west side of Rhodes Avenue and the east side of Ashdale Avenue and
        Parkmount Road.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to get an idea of what this tree inventory will provide, please
        have a look at how it was done in the Long Branch and Annex
        neighborhoods.

        We will be asking residents on these streets to allow Nemo to check the
        trees on your property in order to determine the species, height and
        diameter and overall health of the tree. He will also be teaching us how
        to take care of our trees, and where we might plant trees in the spaces
        available. Nemo has been trained and equipped by Dr. Danijela Puric to
        complete this tree inventory.
