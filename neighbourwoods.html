      <h1>What is Neighbourwoods©?</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.neighbourwoods.org">Neighbourwoods©</a> is a
        community-based tree inventory, monitoring and stewardship planning
        program. Neighbourwoods© is designed to help community groups and
        volunteers conduct an inventory of their urban forest and use that
        information to inform urban forest stewardship in their communities and
        neighborhoods. Neighbourwoods© is also an exciting way of being active,
        interacting with the people in your community and learning all about the
        trees in and around where you live Neighbourwoods© was developed in 1995
        by Dr. Danijela Puric-Mladenovic and Dr. W.A. Kenney from the University
        of Toronto and has been used in communities all over Ontario and beyond.
        We are very excited to add the Craven Road neighborhood to the list!

      <h1>The Objectives of Neighbourwoods©</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To engage the public in urban forest stewardship, conservation,
          management and planning at the neighborhood level;
        </li>
        <li>
          To ensure the collection of standardized and comprehensive data that
          can be used by tree professionals and non-professionals alike; and
        </li>
        <li>
          To inform individual tree and urban forest stewardship based on
          sophisticated tree analysis and advanced data interpretation
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        On June 5th a student from the University of Toronto, who is in the
        Masters of Forestry Program, will be starting an inventory of the trees
        in our neighborhood. The area they are covering includes Craven Road
        stretching from Queen Street to Danforth Avenue, the backyards of the
        houses on the west side of Rhodes Avenue and the east side of Ashdale
        Avenue and Parkmount Road.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to get an idea of what this tree inventory will provide, please
        have a look at how it was done in the Long Branch and Annex
        neighborhoods.

      <p>
        We will be asking residents on these streets to allow the student we
        have hired, to check the trees on your property in order to determine
        the type, size, and health of the tree. The student will also be
        teaching us how to take care of our trees, and where we might plant
        trees in the spaces available. This student will be trained and equipped
        by Dr. Danjiela Puric to complete this tree inventory.
