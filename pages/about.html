      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our goals are to celebrate, protect and enhance the unique heritage and
        character of Craven Road, its urban canopy and its eclectic
        architecture.
      </p>
      <h2>Craven Road</h2>
      <p>
        Craven Road represents an unusual urban condition. Previously known as
        Erie Terrace, the street was originally developed to house lower-income
        laborers and immigrants in the early 20th century. With small dwellings
        lining only the street’s east side, and Craven south of the railway
        tracks having a municipal fence running along the west, this atypical
        thoroughfare was the site of Toronto’s highest concentration of detached
        homes under 500 sf. Today, Craven Road remains a close-knit community
        and unique architectural outpost in an increasingly unaffordable city.

      <h2>Preservation</h2>
      <p>
        A key step to preserving the unique character of what makes Craven Road
        attractive was the need to understand how City of Toronto planning
        developments affect the density on our road. Our residents are working
        together to advocate for responsible development along the Craven Road,
        that takes into account the higher than average density of our street
        and the fact that it is 4.5 meters wide on the north end, and 7.5 meters
        wide on the south end. Preservation of character includes sharing the
        history of this community, promoting community safety, launching
        programs to promote stewardship and educate residents about the benefits
        of preserving and enhancing our tree canopy and environment.
      </p>
      <h2>Toronto’s Street Safety policy</h2>
      <p>
        The City of Toronto has a road classification system that categorizes
        streets based on their function and usage. According to the system,
        one-way streets are classified as arterial roads, which are designed to
        move high volumes of traffic at higher speeds. The minimum width for an
        arterial road is 10.5 meters (34.4 feet). However, Craven Road is 4.5
        meters wide on the north end (between Hanson Road and Danforth Avenue)
        andCraven Road south of the railway line is between 7.26 meters to 7.46
        meters wide. Craven Road south of the railway line has parking on one
        side of the road, but the north end of Craven, considerably narrower,
        does not provide for street parking.
