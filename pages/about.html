      <br />
      <h3>Craven road</h3>
      <p>
        Craven Road represents an unusual urban condition. Previously known as
        Erie Terrace, the street was originally developed to house lower-income
        labourers and immigrants in the early 20th century. With small dwellings
        lining only the street’s east side, and a municipal fence running along
        the west, this atypical thoroughfare was the site of Toronto’s highest
        concentration of detached homes under 500 sf. Today, Craven Road remains
        a close-knit community and unique architectural outpost in an
        increasingly unaffordable city.

      <h3>Preservation</h3>
      <p>
        A key step to preserving the unique character of what makes Craven Road
        attractive was our joining together to discuss a proposal for garden
        suites being planned in the Parkmount Road side of our street. Working
        to advocate for responsible development along the Craven Road
        neighbourhood, that preserves existing character. Preservation of
        character includes sharing the history of this community, promoting
        better transit and community safety and launching programs to promote
        stewardship and educate residents about the benefits of preserving and
        enhancing our <a href="https://www.lbna.ca/tree-canopy-preservation/">tree canopy</a> and environment.
