          Thank you Dr. Danijela Puric and Nemo, for taking the time to teach us
          about our trees.
        </p>

        <p>
          On Monday June 10th our tree inventory starts. Nemo is a Masters of
          Forestry student at the University of Toronto. He will be coming door
          to door, and asking if he can measure the diameter and height of your
          tree, assess it according to 28 criteria that contribute to the health
          and location of your tree. These include the lean of the tree, branch
          attachment, the condition of foliage, crown, roots, trunk, branches
          and more. Some of the residents of Craven Road attended the training
          session on Monday June 3rd and learned interesting facts about how to
          assess the health of trees. Resident volunteers are welcome to help
          Nemo with his measurements! Since the Longbranch Neighbourhood is also
          updating their study, we were joined by their eager students, some of
          whom we can also rely on when having questions about our trees. We
          look forward to learning more in the weeks to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have heard from 50 interested residents so far... and are hoping to
          hear from more of you! Please email us at craven.road@yahoo.com if you
          would like Nemo to look at the trees on your property. For more
          details on <a href="neighbourwoods.html">Neighbourwoods©</a> Our
          inventory area covers: Craven Road from Danforth Avenue to Queen
          Street East, Parkmount Road west facing side looking onto Craven Road,
          entire Rhodes Avenue western side of the street, facing onto Craven
          Road backyards, Ashdale Avenue eastern side of the street, facing the
          municipal fence.
