        Major changes are being proposed by the province for what can be built
        in Toronto.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Province has issued proposed amendments to the regulation of Garden
        Suites and Secondary Suites (otherwise known as Additional Resident
        Units or ARU).
      </p>
      <p>
        This will apply to development that is four storeys or less - basically
        anywhere in our neighbourhoods.
